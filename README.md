# Kalendar Cuti Sekolah

This is a simple React application which fetches data about school holidays and displays them in a readable and responsive manner.

This project is built using React and Vite, which provides a minimal setup for using React with Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and some ESLint rules.

## Project Structure

The project has a few key components:

- `App.jsx`: The main component that fetches and manages the state of the holiday data, and which renders the structure of the page.

- `GroupHeader.jsx`: A subcomponent that formats and displays the header information for each group of holidays.

- `HolidayTable.jsx`: A subcomponent that formats and displays table data for each group's holidays.
